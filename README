Fedora/Drupal Security
======================
The islandora_drupal_filter passes the username of 'anonymous' through to Fedora for unauthenticated 
Drupal Users.  A user with the name of 'anonymous' may have XACML policies applied to them that are
meant to be applied to Drupal users that are not logged in or vice-versa.  This is a potential security
issue that can be plugged by creating a user named 'anonymous' and restricting access to the account.
